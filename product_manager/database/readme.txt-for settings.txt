please have a newline character after setting.txt if you want to modify it manually

This setting.txt decides what competitors are going to be display in front-end. but there might not be this competitor attribute in the backend. 

If the part-time workers add competitor from front-end form, this setting.txt is going to be updated automatically, at the same time, the backend will create the specifed new product attributes and add them to the "Demo Attribute Set"
